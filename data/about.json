  "text": "Hello, we are Evolution2Art.  \nA team of fossil lovers.\n\nEvolution2art is a creation by a group of friends and collectors passionate by beauty that was created thousands or even millions of years ago. Our passion is not limited to fossils alone, we find passion in fine pieces of art created either by nature or by man.\nNext to the scientific importance of our pieces, our interest goes also to the beauty and esthetic surplus a fossil, a hand axe or a meteorite brings to our collection. For many years we have been digging, collecting, preparing and carefully selecting each of our pieces for their high quality and exquisite beauty.\nSome of our pieces are represented in the permanent collection of the Back to the past museum as well as in other museums. Others have been permanently stored in the cabinets of our offices and homes. In the end, we remain but just small collectors.\nOur purpose is most importantly to share our experience, knowledge and private collection with people who posses the same passion as we do. By doing so, we hope that many of you sharing the same passion will appreciate the pieces we have in our collection and will get in contact to discuss or to share information.\nWe hope you enjoy your journey through our website.\n\n\n",
